# sidebar-demo
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Sidebar project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo).

### Overview and Learnings

Main React functionalities I learned: dynamic navigation link, modal implementation and useContext to avoid prop drilling. I made my own setup and styling.
